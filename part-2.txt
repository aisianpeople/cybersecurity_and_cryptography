In April of 2020 Nintendo got hacked and up to 300000 accounts got hacked.  
The hackers had access to the username, email address, date of birth, gender and country.
Nintendo claims that no billing information got hacked but as the hackers
could buy games through Nintendo.  Nintendo refunded the hacked accounts and apoligised, 
encouraging users to use two factor authentication.  they also no longer allowed
the ability to access a Nintendo acount through the use of a Nintendo Network ID.
Nintendo did not reveal how this happened in order to prevent simmilar incidents.
